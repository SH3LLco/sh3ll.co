This site is built on [SilverBullet.md](https://silverbullet.md) and has fantastic features such as [Offline Mode](https://silverbullet.md/Client%20Modes) and more! I chose this platform because I needed the [Live Query](https://silverbullet.md/Live%20Queries) functionality for dynamic organization to solve a [[common problem]] in Cyber Security knowledge bases.

# The goals of this site.
- Provide detailed, accurate, and valuable information in the following tech domains.

    - ==Cybersecurity== - (offense & defense)
    - ==Development== - (desktop/web apps, malware, & exploits)
    - ==Infrastructure== - (local, cloud, & hybrid)
    - ==Administration== - (System and Network)

- Build dynamic queries based on yaml frontmatter that allow you to navigate the site via multiple pathways. You arenâ€™t locked into a folder or one set of navigational clicks. There are multiple ways to get the same information; choose the path that makes the most sense to you.

- Create a [community](https://discord.gg/fUAnjxCEGF) of collaborators dedicated to making one of the best sources of information on the web.
